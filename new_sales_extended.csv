Again my apologies for missing the meeting.




 
Hi,
 
FYI – for the last 2 days we have had poor ISP service, this morning it was extremely bad.  Fortunately, the ISP provider technician found a bad junction wire at the pole just this morning (I just finished meeting with him), he replaced it and we now seem to have a solid connection and transfer rates.
 
I’m sharing this because if a new meeting time was sent I didn’t get it.  I have read the PP sent to me and I don’t have any questions at this time, I want to present it to Management on {{Day}}/{{Day}} and will use the PP for reference.
 
I propose, all things considered, we re-schedule after I have had a discussion with Management; does that sound good to you?




 
Hi {{Name}}, checking in – what are the next steps?
 




 
Hi {{Name}},
 
We had a meeting on resource planning today, and a lot of scenarios were discussed, the position is ‘hold’ for now and we are meeting again on {{Month}} {{Date}}; so I should no more then.
 
Thanks for checking in.  Happy Holidays.

Would love to learn more and discuss how we can help {{Company_Name}} build projects with our engineering and design teams.




 
Hi,
 
The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.  This buys us a little breathing room but I am impressed with them it is only a short stay and we need to address this both in the intermediate-term and how it can be an option for any future… bottlenecks.

Sherry,
 
Can you handle the following client request below?
 
The Cleanliness Index is a set of standards that can be used to measure the cleanliness of the City of Miami Beach’s public areas. The Cleanliness Index scheduling web application was developed using Microsoft’s Silverlight technology and Microsoft will be discontinuing support of Silverlight technology on October 12, 2021. The dropping of support for this technology facilitates the need to redevelop the Cleanliness scheduling application utilizing current web development technologies.
The current cleanliness scheduling application provides the following main areas of functionality:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users.
3. Generates printable driving directions providing the optimal route to visit each task within the selected
assessment.
Parties interested in being considered by the City for the services described herein should submit a proposal in
accordance with Section 4, Submittal Instructions and Format. Responsive proposals will be evaluated in accordance
with the criteria established in Section 7, Evaluation of Responses.
 
 
Statement of Work Required. Consultant shall create a web app using JavaScript Libraries and HTML5 that performs
the following:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments. Jobs are predefined from a Microsoft
SQL database routine and would populate the calendar. The calendar should be created using jQuery
Full Calendar JavaScript Calendar or equivalent.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users by clicking on the job.
3. Store users in a Microsoft SQL database.
4. Allows the assessor to have the option to display printable driving directions providing the optimal route
to visit each task within the selected Assessment. The routing routine should use a navigation software
app.

Hey Sherry,
 
A proposal ASAP before end of week would be very useful with a timeline (week over week) estimated delivery, cost and such so we can go to investors and be sure to get moving into development.
 
There is a current async ML component. We are not married to the idea of having to tie all of those models in real time to Zoom. However, they do need to show up in a meaningful way on the client’s dashboard at some point.
 
Most immediately, if we can get something showing people real time insights in meetings, we are WELL on our way to the next stage of our MVP.
 
Here is an example product: 
 
This is another one (although they built their own video meeting area, we do NOT want to do that but rather plug in as Equalicert has.):
 
 
We do NOT want to be a DEI product but a performance improvement, management, leadership, professional development product.
 
 
Here’s an overview:
 
 
This is the general UX idea.
 
- React/Node
- Python Tensorflow for the AWS ML Models
- We have NLP, and use Audio, Video and the Chat to analyze Emotions (audio) Video (eye movements for engagement) but we are not set on all of our models being integrated right now depending on what's fastest/easiest/possible to integrate to talk in real time with a zoom meeting.
 
Ideally we want:
- Interruption notifications (If someone is interrupting a lot, they get a ping)
- Speaking time (depending on context - so we have 8 different use cases roughly, if someone is monopolizing the conversation based on the context of the call, they get pinged. We will provide the % speaking time intervals for you)
- Emotions (help the meeting leader and individual participants understand how they sound. Is there voice coming across as stressed? anxious? Are they speaking faster than normal? We want to let them know.)*** This will set us apart if you can do this in real time by hooking up to the audio of the meeting and running it through our ML model during the meeting time and sending that information back to the Zoom user in a panel.
 
If we had those three prompts (integrating the machine learning models or not) this would be a HUGE win.
 
Core Deliverables:
- We need a Zoom marketplace approval for the app so users can download it using the marketplace: (we are not set on Zoom but it is preferrable. We need to start somewhere and ultimately will need to move to Teams, Meet capabilities so whatever direction we start in is fine.)
- Paywall for users to be able to pay in order to use the service, usage based, 10 hours meetings free then a price per hour, not determined yet.
In AWS our own app on where users can log in and see their meeting history results
- Admin dashboards (in the mockups) for an administrator of a company (group individual users into the company, also for managers of teams or teachers of a class for example who might need access to aggregated statistics based on groups of individuals in their organization) and
- Individual user dashboard (individual meeting stats that are collected)
 
Our current ML models can already use recordings to analyze videos so we need to hook those up to the dashboard. We have a terrible dashboard on bubble that we need to migrate over essentially. We use integromat to automate sequences.
 
I’ve got this to our devs, but I think I am missing some “tech” vocabulary and direction on this. 
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks!

Great – as for the other pitch, I’m seeing $1,000/month for two individuals to run email campaigns?
 
Are they doing appointment setting?
 
As mentioned on that end I was looking for a guaranteed result of some sort before paying for further BD/Sales help.

Hi Kalyna,
 
My apologies for taking longer than expected to get back to you but there were a few thorough details our team had to go through.
 
Please find below the link for the proposal.
{{Link}}
 
Happy to jump on a quick call to answer any questions. Afternoons work best for us.
 
For the email marketing campaigns, our original proposal was only revolving around LeadGen but we can surely offer you more for less as the referrals are our key interest here. We are right working on scaling our technology right now and are only a few weeks away. Please read about it here: 
{{Link}} (draft version)
 
Feel free to share any thoughts.
 
Thanks,

Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this.
 
This quote is way out of budget for an MVP. How can you reduce this? I especially think 8 weeks for UX is extreme given our current wireframes already in existence, Zoom’s UI to leverage in app and the simplicity of what dashboard we’re asking for users to have access to meeting data.
 
If we were to simplify this MVP even further, what’s the cheapest you can go on a Zoom Marketplace app, integrating some basics like Equalicert has?
Would it be easier on Google as an extension like they have done?
 
I would love a few different options please.
 
Also, in your figmatic link, your videos are unaligned to the laptop screens.
 
I’ve attached an image for your reference.
 
If you can do something on the lead gen side, let me know. I’d love a trial or something along with the promise of sending you referrals upon success. I think this in combination with the MVP development would be a sweetspot for us.
 
Thanks!
 
Warmly,
Kalyna

First my apologies for a long time between communications. We've been more than just busy and as with most projects, everything takes longer than expected.
 
In terms of our last conversation, I was able to reduce the number of pages to ~250 far less than the initial  800 and many of the pages still have a number of images ( in full size)  present. I kept the images as they are linked. with some more work, it could reduce the overall page count to ~200 or less......

"Hi {{Name}}, The boilerplate package includes:

1. Consultation to understand your business and create the campaign including:
     A. Problem-solution pairs
     B. Reframing (If you sell boats, don't sell the boat, sell time on the water)
     C. Drafting invitations to do business (copy that would go into campaigns)
     D. Anticipating objections and writing objections handling collateral
 2. Design (this is an add-on option)
     A. Creating embedded images that can be used to call attention to e-mail campaigns
     B. Designing the templates for use with the marketing and objection handling collateral

After the above 2 steps are done then we will have the ability to continue with...

1. Campaign setup
      A. Organizing the campaign/campaigns into a sequence of steps (e-mail, social, phone)
      B. Tracking progress across campaigns and sales reps (open rates, click-through rates, response rates, appointment rates, proposal rates, closing rates)
      C. Continual process of renewal (revisiting campaigns that are and are not performing well, new idea generation for new invitations to do business).
2. Lead sourcing
       A. Identifying lead sources
       B. Combination of manual and automatic scraping to gather leads and find contacts at those companies
3. Launch
       A. Combining the campaign with the lead sourcing to implement the campaign, contact leads, and monitor metrics

This package is our most basic package and includes several sales reps, a sales manager, the software we use to run the campaign, and myself or one of our other senior staff to draft the invitations to do business and campaign objection handling strategy.

I hope that helps answer your question. We'd like the opportunity to work together, but we don't have much room for the price.

Our most basic package runs ~ $5k per month for the above-mentioned with a minimum commitment of 3 months.

I'm not sure where we could remove/cut while having the campaign still be effective.

For example, if we don't spend the proper time creating the campaign and move to contact customers, we will not get a good response rate. On the other hand, if we don't have the sales support to contact customers we will not do the required numbers to get appointments and ultimately won business

Hi Sherry.

I can make ten minutes next Monday all day or Tuesday am, but then am flying out and then on production.

I can try to make an appointment but Will may be better as a referral based on having more availability.

"Hello {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} fill their B2B sales pipelines with highly qualified prospects, increasing revenue. Our B2B growth program includes 4 major steps:
1. Research
2. Demand Generation
3. Meetings/Appointments (relationship building)
4. Closing (revenue generation)
These four steps generate a revenue-building system from scratch. This means that, unlike other companies, we do more than merely set appointments. For instance, our team of researchers gathers live data for prospects who are in the market, right now, for your solution. We do this by accessing 10,000+ job boards, conference listings, and more, building a list of active prospects. From there, our sales team reaches out to these potential customers to set up appointments. Then, we loop in your team to these appointments, including pitch writing, adjustment, analysis, relationship building and finally closing. Once we start working together, we will write the pitches using your collateral, and schedule a kickoff with our sales and research teams to consult with you on constructing the initial lists.

Hi Matthewdaddino,
We've seen many times where a current engineering team may not be meeting expectations. If this is true with your team, we've created a Project Hand Off Checklist where our ex-Google team will take over and begin executing your project within 1-week of handoff and we will turn the ship around.
We've developed digital products for SugarCRM, Google, PocketGems, Airware, Cape, Marie Kondo, and over 70+ other startups around the world, and we'd like to do the same for MAKERS NUTRITION.
James Gutierrez, CEO of Insikt, said ""Punch delivers, plain and simple.""
In our Project Hand Off Checklist, we will make sure we don't miss anything, including code documentation, hosting, codebase requirements, versioning access, administration, testing, and data dumps.
<image002.png>
Once handoff to our Punch team is complete, you will see a proven, tested engineering process that will quickly execute and exceed your expectations. 
Take a look at our engineering process here:

"Hi {{Name}}, The boilerplate package includes:

1. Consultation to understand your business and create the campaign including:
     A. Problem-solution pairs
     B. Reframing (If you sell boats, don't sell the boat, sell time on the water)
     C. Drafting invitations to do business (copy that would go into campaigns)
     D. Anticipating objections and writing objections handling collateral
 2. Design (this is an add-on option)
     A. Creating embedded images that can be used to call attention to e-mail campaigns
     B. Designing the templates for use with the marketing and objection handling collateral

After the above 2 steps are done then we will have the ability to continue with...

1. Campaign setup
      A. Organizing the campaign/campaigns into a sequence of steps (e-mail, social, phone)
      B. Tracking progress across campaigns and sales reps (open rates, click-through rates, response rates, appointment rates, proposal rates, closing rates)
      C. Continual process of renewal (revisiting campaigns that are and are not performing well, new idea generation for new invitations to do business).
2. Lead sourcing
       A. Identifying lead sources
       B. Combination of manual and automatic scraping to gather leads and find contacts at those companies
3. Launch
       A. Combining the campaign with the lead sourcing to implement the campaign, contact leads, and monitor metrics

This package is our most basic package and includes several sales reps, a sales manager, the software we use to run the campaign, and myself or one of our other senior staff to draft the invitations to do business and campaign objection handling strategy.

I hope that helps answer your question. We'd like the opportunity to work together, but we don't have much room for the price.

Our most basic package runs ~ $5k per month for the above-mentioned with a minimum commitment of 3 months.

I'm not sure where we could remove/cut while having the campaign still be effective.

For example, if we don't spend the proper time creating the campaign and move to contact customers, we will not get a good response rate. On the other hand, if we don't have the sales support to contact customers we will not do the required numbers to get appointments and ultimately won business

"Hi {{Name}}, Thanks for reaching out. To launch and maintain these campaigns is an enormous amount of work. We need to spend the time to...
 
1. Understand your business
2. Think creatively about how to reach customers (invitations to do business derived from problem-solution pairs).
3. Identify creative ways to find leads.
4. Create the campaigns in a way where we have a 360-degree view of the customer (Social, email, phone, chat)
5. Work the pipeline and stay engaged while we help build a relationship with the prospect
6. Ultimately move them along to a close.
 
In addition to the above steps, we have to work with clients on upgrading their collateral and website because those pieces dictate the extent to which we can support them.
 
I understand that you would like to move forward however we cannot do this work without being paid for it. I understand that you want a results-driven team, however, our outreach projects are structured with both components:
 
A.) A monthly stipend to pay the bills and all the above creative work.
B.) A contingency commission that is paid to the sales rep for them to stay motivated.
 
I think you will have a hard time finding a quality team that will execute what you want strictly on a contingency basis.
 
If things change feel free to reach out.

I completely understand your concern regarding the timelines and cost estimates that we have proposed for this project. As far as the proportionality of pricing to the efficiency and quality of work are related, Punch’s expertise will never be questioned from your side, we make sure we deliver within the timelines that have been put forward by our team.
 
Also, as we had a brief intro, I would suggest a detailed discussion of your necessities and extent of work in our next call and that will allow me to revise the cost and timelines more accurately, taking into account the current needs of {{Company}}.

"Hello Adam, Erol, and Verdi,
I hope you are all ok and doing well. These emails are from several years ago, so Iâ€™m just hoping they still work.
You may recall that we engaged a bit, but I donâ€™t think ever formally, on our RideStop product and launch with Irvine Company and Lyft a few years ago. Covid slowed that project down, and we are now about to launch a new series of products in a new category we have defined as real-time, micro-location (RTML) information, services and communications. We have over 15 patents on 6 key components of a new paradigm to support the next and future generations of hyper-local RTML information and services as an overarching platform for numerous verticals and services, including rideshare, deliveries, IoT, asset management and services, etc. 
We recently quickly raised significant initial funding, and we are likely going to raise more in the next few months with a view toward a significant institutional or strategic Seed or A round later this year. Iâ€™m sure you will agree this is a very big, potentially change the world type technology from AI, robotics, drone, and human scale interactions POVs, and we want to consider going big from the start â€“ or at least have a plan to do so once we get our institution funding. As a big platform and tech play, there are numerous vertical products and markets we will impact, so we need some design at the top level to ensure that there are some common elements across all/most use cases. We also intend to license our technology and platform across various markets, still TBD, and that will raise some architecture and branding/market matters. 
There is a major visual component and very small device/ signage component to our most timely and exciting project, and we are looking for help for creative design, UX/UI, and likely marketing and creative. My recollection is that you have a very good creative team, but also combine that with outsourced engineering and coding to provide an optional end to end solution. 
Can we find time for a quick initial call to see if it makes sense to schedule a longer call to explore working together? Weâ€™ll need a mutual NDA pretty early in the process, and that initial call can help us both understand if thatâ€™s appropriate for deeper discussions.

Sherry,
 
Can you handle the following client request below?
 
The Cleanliness Index is a set of standards that can be used to measure the cleanliness of the City of Miami Beach’s public areas. The Cleanliness Index scheduling web application was developed using Microsoft’s Silverlight technology and Microsoft will be discontinuing support of Silverlight technology on October 12, 2021. The dropping of support for this technology facilitates the need to redevelop the Cleanliness scheduling application utilizing current web development technologies.
The current cleanliness scheduling application provides the following main areas of functionality:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users.
3. Generates printable driving directions providing the optimal route to visit each task within the selected
assessment.
Parties interested in being considered by the City for the services described herein should submit a proposal in
accordance with Section 4, Submittal Instructions and Format. Responsive proposals will be evaluated in accordance
with the criteria established in Section 7, Evaluation of Responses.
 
 
Statement of Work Required. Consultant shall create a web app using JavaScript Libraries and HTML5 that performs
the following:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments. Jobs are predefined from a Microsoft
SQL database routine and would populate the calendar. The calendar should be created using jQuery
Full Calendar JavaScript Calendar or equivalent.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users by clicking on the job.
3. Store users in a Microsoft SQL database.
4. Allows the assessor to have the option to display printable driving directions providing the optimal route
to visit each task within the selected Assessment. The routing routine should use a navigation software
app.

"We help companies like {{company}} design, develop and engineer products from the ground up. We specialize in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development so you can tell right away the long-term sustainability of a product concept before investing more time and money in creating all possible features. This significantly reduces your long-term risk.

Our MVP program follows 4 key Concept-to-Reality steps:

Brainstorming — We define the product using SWOT analysis, revenue model validation, product differentiation from competitors, and key feature definition.

Prioritizing — We define the feature timeline by shortlisting those features with maximum benefits, defining the minimum viable product, and by removing non-critical features from the pipeline.

Developing — We take the MVP project from concept to code by including QA, project management, a seasoned coding team, daily coding, creation of the minimum viable product, bi-weekly release cycle, continuous improvement, and weekly meetings to review product progress.

Scaling — We build the future, today, by preparing for mass commercialization, by planning out versions 2?5 features, and by identifying new sources of capital and growth.

Check out: http://www.punch.cool/services/engineering/

We would love to set up a call to discuss your concept, and to answer a few key questions. From this, we will return our complete analysis and proposed MVP timeline.

"Hi {{Name}},
 
I found your company on Indeed and wanted to discuss how our ShadowProgram could help ITX Corp increase engineering productivity 2x in a 30-day pilot.
 
Our ShadowProgram pairs our ex-Google verified team of full-stack, back-end, and/or mobile engineers with your engineering team to double current engineering velocity; each of your engineer's ""Shadow"" will enable a 2-fold increase in storyboard tracker points delivered per sprint after the ShadowProgram is initiated within 30-days.
 
We've executed projects for Airware, Cape, PocketGems, Marie Kondo, The League, and over 70+ other companies and startups successfully with our ShadowProgram.
 
Our ShadowProgram often works in one of two ways –
 
1-to-1: Our engineers pair up 1-to-1 with your engineers, so each engineer on your team has a Punch Shadow that's doubling output, your engineer's ""Shadow"" is often working on the same feature or deliverable
 
Team-to-team: We split responsibilities by team, where we take certain features or milestones as well as your team members, and double overall output, often splitting up segments of work
 
I'd like to set up a call to discuss a 30-day pilot of our Shadow program with you, how does your calendar look this week and we can set up a time?

Thanks for sending the information.
Apologies, I had a long day of work on Friday and by the end of the day, I had forgotten about sending you the MSA.
Here is the MSA model, the SoW model, and the Contractor Agreement (that the individual contractors would need to sign to be notified of the expectations around non-compete, confidentiality, etc).
—-----------------------
 
Thank you for sending these over. I'll send you the signed copy shortly. 
 
Can you please specify this (screenshot below) as this is a bit confusing
—----------------------
 
As I think we are moving towards an agency contractor ship agreement the above-mentioned screenshot would not be required for us to fill.
 
Thanks,
—-------------------
 
Please find attached the signed copies of the MSA's from our side. We will keep the contractor agreement and get that signed when we start the augmentation process.
 
What does your calendar look like for Thursday or Friday this week to discuss further and start the augmentation process? 
 
Thanks,
—-----------------
 
{{Name}}
Sorry, I cannot see the screenshot you mention.
What I can provide as context, is that we use the same MSA for all types of engagements (C2C, C2H, and Direct Hire). That's why it has the provision of a ""hiring fee"" or a ""conversion fee"". 
It is the SoW that defines what is the engagement type, and in the case of agencies like yours, we would simply do a C2C, with no conversion clause. 
Hope that helps build the right context.
If you are in agreement with the MSA (understanding that it includes some clauses that will not be invoked) I can have our legal counsel send you a link for an electronic signature (with HelloSign).

Hi {{Name}}!
 
It was great to meet you too. 
 
The person you mention, for what position would it be? So we can schedule it.
 
I share the most critical positions that we need to cover:
 
Sr Frontend Developer: {{Link}}
Sr Backend Developer: {{Link}}
System Administrator: {{Link}}
DevOps Engineer: {{Link}}
 
It is mandatory for all positions that candidates have a fluent level of English. Especially for the DevOps position, this point is totally defining since it will have direct contact with the client.
In addition to fluency, we consider that communication skills, in general, are a key point, and so the ability of multi-location and multi-cultural teamwork.
 
Another important point is the possibility of working in the client's time: {{Time}} and for DevOps and SysAdmin the person should be able to cover on-call rotations.
 
If you need any other additional information, do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Thank you!

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

"Hello {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} fill their B2B sales pipelines with highly qualified prospects, increasing revenue. Our B2B growth program includes 4 major steps:
1. Research
2. Demand Generation
3. Meetings/Appointments (relationship building)
4. Closing (revenue generation)
These four steps generate a revenue-building system from scratch. This means that, unlike other companies, we do more than merely set appointments. For instance, our team of researchers gathers live data for prospects who are in the market, right now, for your solution. We do this by accessing 10,000+ job boards, conference listings, and more, building a list of active prospects. From there, our sales team reaches out to these potential customers to set up appointments. Then, we loop in your team to these appointments, including pitch writing, adjustment, analysis, relationship building and finally closing. Once we start working together, we will write the pitches using your collateral, and schedule a kickoff with our sales and research teams to consult with you on constructing the initial lists. Please let me know if you have any questions. Cheers, {{Sender_Name}}  ",1,,0.020213726

I’m really sorry I missed the meeting.  I had a family emergency which is Ok now and I’m back in the office.

Again my apologies for missing the meeting.

Hi,
 
FYI – for the last 2 days we have had poor ISP service, this morning it was extremely bad.  Fortunately, the ISP provider technician found a bad junction wire at the pole just this morning (I just finished meeting with him), he replaced it and we now seem to have a solid connection and transfer rates.
 
I’m sharing this because if a new meeting time was sent I didn’t get it.  I have read the PP sent to me and I don’t have any questions at this time, I want to present it to Management on {{Day}}/{{Day}} and will use the PP for reference.
 
I propose, all things considered, we re-schedule after I have had a discussion with Management; does that sound good to you?

Hi {{Name}}, checking in – what are the next steps?

Hi {{Name}},
 
We had a meeting on resource planning today, and a lot of scenarios were discussed, the position is ‘hold’ for now and we are meeting again on {{Month}} {{Date}}; so I should no more then.
 
Thanks for checking in.  Happy Holidays.

Hi {{Name}}, following up on {{Name}} email below. How'd the planning meeting on {{Month}} {{Date}}?
 
Would love to learn more and discuss how we can help {{Company_Name}} build projects with our engineering and design teams.

Hi,
 
The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.  This buys us a little breathing room but I am impressed with them it is only a short stay and we need to address this both in the intermediate-term and how it can be an option for any future… bottlenecks.
 
I appreciate the check-in, for now, we have to wait and see.",1,,0.013628375

Thank you for reaching our again. Whatâ€™s your availability to connect on Thursday?
Thanks,",1,,0.020457687
"Hi {{Name}}, Thanks for reaching out. To launch and maintain these campaigns is an enormous amount of work. We need to spend the time to...
 
1. Understand your business
2. Think creatively about how to reach customers (invitations to do business derived from problem-solution pairs).
3. Identify creative ways to find leads.
4. Create the campaigns in a way where we have a 360-degree view of the customer (Social, email, phone, chat)
5. Work the pipeline and stay engaged while we help build a relationship with the prospect
6. Ultimately move them along to a close.
 
In addition to the above steps, we have to work with clients on upgrading their collateral and website because those pieces dictate the extent to which we can support them.
 
I understand that you would like to move forward however we cannot do this work without being paid for it. I understand that you want a results-driven team, however, our outreach projects are structured with both components:
 
A.) A monthly stipend to pay the bills and all the above creative work.
B.) A contingency commission that is paid to the sales rep for them to stay motivated.
 
I think you will have a hard time finding a quality team that will execute what you want strictly on a contingency basis.
 
If things change feel free to reach out.

I completely understand your concern regarding the timelines and cost estimates that we have proposed for this project. As far as the proportionality of pricing to the efficiency and quality of work are related, Punch’s expertise will never be questioned from your side, we make sure we deliver within the timelines that have been put forward by our team.
 
Also, as we had a brief intro, I would suggest a detailed discussion of your necessities and extent of work in our next call and that will allow me to revise the cost and timelines more accurately, taking into account the current needs of {{Company}}.
Let’s get on the phone and talk this out further.
 
Best Regards.

Hey Raahim,
     No worries I need the press given how much email comes my way. I've seen your pdf and I'm looking forward to our call. Yes, I have time at the scheduled time with the team.   Let's chat today. 
 
—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

Hello Ahshan!
My name is Julia, I'm HR Manager from Webxloo company.
Previously, we had a conversation about Punch Shadow Program.
We see that we need more experienced resources to work for us, so contacting you one more time.
Need to ask you more questions about this program:
1. What is the technical level of developers you offer to work with us for $30-65 for each resource? Is there a junior/middle/senior level? What is the real price you pay them?
2. How would you measure their productivity?
3. What will you do if a developer miss working hours, will be absent for 2-3 hours? Is there fine?
Will be grateful for your reply to continue a conversation about future cooperation.",1,,0.116926487

"Hi Samantha,
 
Just wanted to quickly send in a quick question: 
 
For the landing page, we have a button that opens up a Calendly invite pop-up to schedule meetings. Currently, we have a dummy account put in place, but could you please send in a (preferably) Calendly invite link to put there for you?
 
Cheers
—------------------------

We don’t use Calendly at the moment.
 
What is the alternative?
—------------------

Would you happen to use any sort of Calendar application to book meetings?
 
HubSpot Calendar, TidyCal, or any of the sort might work.  
 
If you don't have a booking application in place - we could direct the users to your existing 'Contact Us' page on your website. 
 
Let me know and we can go from there.

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

"Hello Simon,
 
I found you on Indeed looking for a Data & Examinations Assistant and wanted to reach out to discuss how we can help with Bridlington School's artificial intelligence/machine learning strategy.
 
We’re an ex-Google-founded engineering team specializing in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) implementations. We’ve worked on both supervised and unsupervised strategies, classification, time-series, quant/financial, and reinforcement learning problems.
 
Our general approach to ML / AI involves identifying direct and alternative data streams, causality, correlation, and importance testing, data normalization, model strategy development and tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and F-1 score tuning through meta-labeling.
 
We’ve worked with Cape, Dispatchr, 1-Page, Google, and many other companies requiring AI and ML.
 
I’d like to set up a time to discuss how Punch can help Bridlington School’s AI/ML needs.
 
Can we discuss it later this afternoon?

Sherry From Punch

I wanted to follow up on my email below about working together on artificial intelligence/machine learning areas. I’m including a complimentary white paper that goes more in-depth on our feature engineering process for ML/AI projects including the importance of measuring not just feature correlation but causality and how to do so.
 
After you’ve had a chance to review, I’m hoping we can discuss Bridlington School ML/AI needs and how we may be able to help with AI strategy and implementation.
 
Thanks,

"Hi {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} boost their B2C visibility, market share and profit through Punch’s B2C growth program. This program consists of a 4-step process:

1. Analysis — We dive deep into ads being run by your top 1 to 3 competitors on Facebook, AdWords, Google+, etc., to understand what they’re doing right and what you could be doing better. We perform analyses on keywords, SEO, website traffic and app store traffic, to see where you may be missing golden opportunities and where you may be losing your visitors. We gather data on,
Who are your customers?
How {{company}} is doing with getting them?
What does it cost to acquire a new customer?

This data helps us understand the hopes and fears of your prospects and how best to harness those attitudes to help them become new customers.

2. Plan creation — We take a survey of {{company}}’s current marketing channels to see what is being done now. This helps us understand what steps are being left out and what opportunities are being missed. Next, we analyze marketing channels new to {{company}} to determine the best approach for expanding your market reach. This is followed by tailoring a plan to achieve specific advertising milestones:
to grow every month {{company}}’s number of customers,
to get more engagement from existing customers which will strengthen their commitment to the {{company}} brand, and
to reduce customer churn.

We target double-digit, month-on-month growth in the initial, 90-day test, and an overall 50% reduction in customer churn.

3. Execution — We execute the plan, which always starts with original content creation. The plan includes monitoring and analysis of incremental results, plus daily meetings to review progress. It also includes ads management, engagement metrics, and regular performance review. We update the plan with any required changes to ensure we meet plan goals.

4. Refinement — We make daily, weekly, and monthly adjustments to the plan based on ongoing performance. Such refinements are based on monthly and quarterly customer acquisition, plus CPC and CPM benchmarks and metrics.

Overall goals:
Double-digit, month-on-month growth in new customers,
Grow existing customer engagement by 50%,
Reduce customer churn by 50%, and
Reduce ad cost per new customer acquisition by at least 20%.

Hi,
 
FYI – for the last 2 days we have had poor ISP service, this morning it was extremely bad.  Fortunately, the ISP provider technician found a bad junction wire at the pole just this morning (I just finished meeting with him), he replaced it and we now seem to have a solid connection and transfer rates.
 
I’m sharing this because if a new meeting time was sent I didn’t get it.  I have read the PP sent to me and I don’t have any questions at this time, I want to present it to Management on {{Day}}/{{Day}} and will use the PP for reference.
 
I propose, all things considered, we re-schedule after I have had a discussion with Management; does that sound good to you?

Hi,
 
The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.  This buys us a little breathing room but I am impressed with them it is only a short stay and we need to address this both in the intermediate-term and how it can be an option for any future… bottlenecks.

"Hello Simon,
 
I found you on Indeed looking for a Data & Examinations Assistant and wanted to reach out to discuss how we can help with Bridlington School's artificial intelligence/machine learning strategy.
 
We’re an ex-Google-founded engineering team specializing in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) implementations. We’ve worked on both supervised and unsupervised strategies, classification, time-series, quant/financial, and reinforcement learning problems.
 
Our general approach to ML / AI involves identifying direct and alternative data streams, causality, correlation, and importance testing, data normalization, model strategy development and tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and F-1 score tuning through meta-labeling.
 
We’ve worked with Cape, Dispatchr, 1-Page, Google, and many other companies requiring AI and ML.
 
I’d like to set up a time to discuss how Punch can help Bridlington School’s AI/ML needs.
 
Can we discuss it later this afternoon?

I wanted to follow up on my email below about working together on artificial intelligence/machine learning areas.

After you’ve had a chance to review, I’m hoping we can discuss Bridlington School ML/AI needs and how we may be able to help with AI strategy and implementation.
 
Thanks,

"Hi {{Name}},
 
I found your company on Indeed and wanted to discuss how our ShadowProgram could help ITX Corp increase engineering productivity 2x in a 30-day pilot.
 
Our ShadowProgram pairs our ex-Google verified team of full-stack, back-end, and/or mobile engineers with your engineering team to double current engineering velocity; each of your engineer's ""Shadow"" will enable a 2-fold increase in storyboard tracker points delivered per sprint after the ShadowProgram is initiated within 30-days.
 
We've executed projects for Airware, Cape, PocketGems, Marie Kondo, The League, and over 70+ other companies and startups successfully with our ShadowProgram.
 
Our ShadowProgram often works in one of two ways –
 
1-to-1: Our engineers pair up 1-to-1 with your engineers, so each engineer on your team has a Punch Shadow that's doubling output, your engineer's ""Shadow"" is often working on the same feature or deliverable
 
Team-to-team: We split responsibilities by team, where we take certain features or milestones as well as your team members, and double overall output, often splitting up segments of work
 
I'd like to set up a call to discuss a 30-day pilot of our Shadow program with you, how does your calendar look this week and we can set up a time?

Thanks for sending the information.
Apologies, I had a long day of work on Friday and by the end of the day, I had forgotten about sending you the MSA.
Here is the MSA model, the SoW model, and the Contractor Agreement (that the individual contractors would need to sign to be notified of the expectations around non-compete, confidentiality, etc).

Thank you for sending these over. I'll send you the signed copy shortly. 
 
Can you please specify this (screenshot below) as this is a bit confusing
—----------------------
 
As I think we are moving towards an agency contractor ship agreement the above-mentioned screenshot would not be required for us to fill.
 
Thanks,
—-------------------
 
Please find attached the signed copies of the MSA's from our side. We will keep the contractor agreement and get that signed when we start the augmentation process.
 
What does your calendar look like for Thursday or Friday this week to discuss further and start the augmentation process? 
 
Thanks,
—-----------------
 
{{Name}}
Sorry, I cannot see the screenshot you mention.
What I can provide as context, is that we use the same MSA for all types of engagements (C2C, C2H, and Direct Hire). That's why it has the provision of a ""hiring fee"" or a ""conversion fee"". 
It is the SoW that defines what is the engagement type, and in the case of agencies like yours, we would simply do a C2C, with no conversion clause. 
Hope that helps build the right context.
If you are in agreement with the MSA (understanding that it includes some clauses that will not be invoked) I can have our legal counsel send you a link for an electronic signature (with HelloSign).

It was great to meet you too.

I share the most critical positions that we need to cover:
 
Sr Frontend Developer: {{Link}}
Sr Backend Developer: {{Link}}
System Administrator: {{Link}}
DevOps Engineer: {{Link}}
 
It is mandatory for all positions that candidates have a fluent level of English. Especially for the DevOps position, this point is totally defining since it will have direct contact with the client.
In addition to fluency, we consider that communication skills, in general, are a key point, and so the ability of multi-location and multi-cultural teamwork.
 
Another important point is the possibility of working in the client's time: {{Time}} and for DevOps and SysAdmin the person should be able to cover on-call rotations.
 
If you need any other additional information, do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Thank you!

"We help companies like {{company}} design, develop and engineer products from the ground up. We specialize in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development so you can tell right away the long-term sustainability of a product concept before investing more time and money in creating all possible features. This significantly reduces your long-term risk.

Our MVP program follows 4 key Concept-to-Reality steps:

Brainstorming — We define the product using SWOT analysis, revenue model validation, product differentiation from competitors, and key feature definition.

Prioritizing — We define the feature timeline by shortlisting those features with maximum benefits, defining the minimum viable product, and by removing non-critical features from the pipeline.

Developing — We take the MVP project from concept to code by including QA, project management, a seasoned coding team, daily coding, creation of the minimum viable product, bi-weekly release cycle, continuous improvement, and weekly meetings to review product progress.

Scaling — We build the future, today, by preparing for mass commercialization, by planning out versions 2?5 features, and by identifying new sources of capital and growth.

Check out: http://www.punch.cool/services/engineering/

Alternatively, book a meeting here 

Cheers, 




Hey there,

Do you have an example of an educational website you’ve done that i could see as a sample?

P.





Hi Patrick, sure I'm attaching a case study for MedCerts. I also took a screen grab from case study of the results [pasted below]. Soon after this case study was published, MedCerts was acquired (reference: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201117006247/en/Stride-Inc.-to-Acquire-Healthcare-Talent-Development-Pioneer-MedCerts)

Would love to learn more about your goals and how we can help you grow your business through conversion focused design. I'm cc'ing my business development manager, Sheharyar, to help us find some time to talk. I'll also ask my CEO, Verdi Ergün, to join the call to learn firsthand what Muse is looking to achieve in 2022.

If we can set something up for just after the holidays it would be great!Hi Ahsan,

Before we get on a call, I’d love to get a better sense of how time and pricing works across your team. I understand both are quite complex, but I’ll need some sort of guide to assess the fitness with the projects we have.

For some context, we’ll need a movie website in Q1 for a documentary we are releasing on Crypto. This is straightforward with a mailing list and series of free video resources on the site.

We are also launching the Muse Storytelling Academy, which is bringing all of our courses, community, and certification under one roof. This is far more complex and is currently built on Wordpress. This would be more of an audit, ux testing, and design improvements. That said, it’s also going to need to start selling in January. 

Let me know if either of those are up your alley and please give me some sense of how to think through timing and pricing.

Thanks so much,

P.



Hey Patrick, I understand with the Muse Storytelling Academy it's pretty urgent if you want to be selling in January.  Based on the two projects you've outlined let me and Sherry put together a lightweight proposal for you to skim through that will cover rough timelines and rough costs, as the basis for a further conversation. @Sheharyar Asif will follow up before the weekend.Thanks - that is much appreciated!

I’ll review and circle back once you get those over

P.



Hi Patrick,

Happy Holidays.

We will have the proposal ready by day end tomorrow and I wanted to ask if you are available for a quick call? We would love to walk you through them and answer any questions you might have.

We are available tomorrow afternoon. Does 12:30 pm PST work for you? I can share invites once you confirm or you can also pick a slot directly from our calendly link: https://calendly.com/punch-labs/30mins

Thanks,

Sherry



Hey Sherry,

At this stage I’ve only received a cold email and some basic information. I’d really need to review a bit more to ensure the call is worthwhile. That can be the proposal you’re sending over, but I’m also happy to take a look at a past proposal - that will also tell me much more about how y’all operate and the general cost and timings involved

Thanks :)

P.






Hi Patrick,

We have put together the proposals for both projects you have mentioned. You can review them here on these links:

I have also shared some other proposals from the old pipeline as well.

Please do share your thoughts upon reviewing them which will allow us to keep the ball rolling here.

Thanks,

Hi Sherry,

Thanks so much for putting this together. I’m looping in Evan to help us find a time to chat.

Are you available tomorrow early on PST time?

In advance, i am curious what platform the film website would be built on and whether our team would be able to make updates as the development progresses. Is this a Squarespace type of installation or something else?

I’m also curious about the branding included and how much of that allows us to look at the fonts, colors, and a wordmark for the movie.

Let’s start by focusing on the film and then I’ll have updates on the Academy side soon.

Thanks so much 




Patrick We are available tomorrow at any time after 9:30 AM PST.

We also have a free slot at 8:30 AM PST.

Let me know what works for you and I will share the invites.

Thank you.




Hi Sheharyar!

1PM PST works great for Patrick. 

Thanks so much!

Sincerely, 




Hey Verdi,

If you felt you could do a package deal on The Highest of Stakes site, the Muse Storytelling Academy site, and the main Muse Storytelling site all in at $35k AND you could take crypto, i could probably make all three happen.

We could pay in ETH or Hex, that would be up to you, and I’d get you that call to walk you through getting yourself setup and answer any questions.

We would need to ensure all are scoped properly, but only the THoS needs some brand work, the MSA site is more about updating and aggregate content to a new template, and the Muse site is largely a more elevate UX and improved messaging (which we could provide).

Let me know your thoughts,

P.





Hi Patrick,

That sounds amazing. We are open for payment in crypto and are more inclined towards Ethereum. I would appreciate that call for the onboarding process and any further insights.

Can we settle at $40k as we really believe the Muse Storytelling Academy site would need some extra effort on the templates to elevate the design and resonate it with the brand identity?

We will bring forward our creative team consisting of All-Star Branding and Graphics experts and Ui/Ux Designers along with experienced developers to achieve a brand image that you will be proud to display and which will communicate the proper tone not only to the targeted market segment but also to the world-at-large.

If all seems okay, I can ask my team to get a services agreement in place to get us started next week.

Verdi




Hi Verdi,

I can make that work, but I’d need two main things.

We’d need to get each scoped to ensure we’re aligned on expectations. I believe you have THoS and MSA (muse storytelling academy). The main Muse site has nothing new our current site doesn’t have, it’s more so just the reframing our services and fresh design (but same brand).

The second thing would be you two chatting with Will, our managing partner, as the site and MSA are his leads. As i can cover the full cost, he will be very interested, but the three of you would need to connect first before full go ahead.

Let me know when you could get the updated proposals over and i can then get you time booked with Will

P.




Hi Patrick,

I will have them ready by Monday. Once you get a chance to review them, I will coordinate with you for some time to get introduced to Will.

Does that work for you?




Thanks Sherry,

I’m on set most of the day Monday but will reply in the evening and keep things moving

P.




That sounds good.

A very Happy New Year to you and your team.

I’d love to show what we can do for April & Oak via expanding support hours, introducing new support languages, establishing new support channels, and augmenting existing support efforts.
 
Please take a look at the attached document and let me know when would be a good time to discuss it.

Hello Darren,
 
I just wanted to follow up and see if our Outsourced Customer Service Program may be a fit for April & Oak?
 
If you’re interested in expanding support hours from 8 to 16 or 24, or adding new support languages, or taking part in our customer research audit which is included complimentary, let’s set up a time to discuss later this afternoon?
 
Thanks,

Hi Ehsan,
 
Can you please provide me with pricing for the below?
 
We would be interested in a single 24/7 support agent, taking calls and inbound inquiries from Zendesk.
 
Many thanks,
 
—-------------------------
 
Hello Darren,
 
For 24/7 Support, we appoint two sales agents to cover the whole shift, providing call support & inbound inquiries from Zendesk (as per your requirement)
 
The agents are well equipped & trained to handle customer support including working on weekends to ensure customer retention.
 
The cost of 24/7 Support is $3000 monthly, which is broken down to $1500 dollars for one support agent
 
If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Cheers

Have you got any updates for me yet?

Hello Darren,
 
Just quickly following up again to check if you got the chance to review our pricing & case study.

First my apologies for a long time between communications. We've been more than just busy and as with most projects, everything takes longer than expected.
 
In terms of our last conversation, I was able to reduce the number of pages to ~250 far less than the initial  800 and many of the pages still have a number of images ( in full size)  present. I kept the images as they are linked. with some more work, it could reduce the overall page count to ~200 or less......
 
Let me know your updated thoughts and let's continue our interaction as the other aspect of our project, web scraping using python with the appropriate returns is still in play and this database would get that off the ground effectively.

Your previous data result ( Demo GUF data below)  and the fields are on track overall, the only real difference would be the deeper levels of descriptions for both the funding: ie.  timing of the offerings (rolling or deadlines) using our descriptors of their industries  (Industries column) for more granularity, ie: fintech then to hardware/service/software as an example.  Our schema has industries broken into subsets. Obviously, only available data for these subsets will be added to the final and ongoing database.   Does this assist in clarification?
 
 
I'm reviewing the referral agreement and will have some feedback next week.

"Hi {{Name}}, Thanks for reaching out. To launch and maintain these campaigns is an enormous amount of work. We need to spend the time to...
 
1. Understand your business
2. Think creatively about how to reach customers (invitations to do business derived from problem-solution pairs).
3. Identify creative ways to find leads.
4. Create the campaigns in a way where we have a 360-degree view of the customer (Social, email, phone, chat)
5. Work the pipeline and stay engaged while we help build a relationship with the prospect
6. Ultimately move them along to a close.
 
In addition to the above steps, we have to work with clients on upgrading their collateral and website because those pieces dictate the extent to which we can support them.
 
I understand that you would like to move forward however we cannot do this work without being paid for it. I understand that you want a results-driven team, however, our outreach projects are structured with both components:
 
A.) A monthly stipend to pay the bills and all the above creative work.
B.) A contingency commission that is paid to the sales rep for them to stay motivated.
 
I think you will have a hard time finding a quality team that will execute what you want strictly on a contingency basis.
 
If things change feel free to reach out.

I completely understand your concern regarding the timelines and cost estimates that we have proposed for this project. As far as the proportionality of pricing to the efficiency and quality of work are related, Punch’s expertise will never be questioned from your side, we make sure we deliver within the timelines that have been put forward by our team.

The Cleanliness Index is a set of standards that can be used to measure the cleanliness of the City of Miami Beach’s public areas. The Cleanliness Index scheduling web application was developed using Microsoft’s Silverlight technology and Microsoft will be discontinuing support of Silverlight technology on October 12, 2021. The dropping of support for this technology facilitates the need to redevelop the Cleanliness scheduling application utilizing current web development technologies.
The current cleanliness scheduling application provides the following main areas of functionality:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users.
3. Generates printable driving directions providing the optimal route to visit each task within the selected
assessment.
Parties interested in being considered by the City for the services described herein should submit a proposal in
accordance with Section 4, Submittal Instructions and Format. Responsive proposals will be evaluated in accordance
with the criteria established in Section 7, Evaluation of Responses.
 
 
Statement of Work Required. Consultant shall create a web app using JavaScript Libraries and HTML5 that performs
the following:
1. Displays a printable calendar containing predefined assignments. Jobs are predefined from a Microsoft
SQL database routine and would populate the calendar. The calendar should be created using jQuery
Full Calendar JavaScript Calendar or equivalent.
2. Allows for jobs contained within the calendar to be assigned to users by clicking on the job.
3. Store users in a Microsoft SQL database.
4. Allows the assessor to have the option to display printable driving directions providing the optimal route
to visit each task within the selected Assessment. The routing routine should use a navigation software
app.

I would love to put together a proposal if I will have any details on the scope of work. It will allow us to share some team details, timelines, and cost estimates.
 
I can put together a quick document on the pricing and what you can expect from the team on Design and Development.
 
Let me know what you think and I can keep it moving forward here.
 
Thanks,

—---------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
A proposal ASAP before end of week would be very useful with a timeline (week over week) estimated delivery, cost and such so we can go to investors and be sure to get moving into development.
 
There is a current async ML component. We are not married to the idea of having to tie all of those models in real time to Zoom. However, they do need to show up in a meaningful way on the client’s dashboard at some point.
 
Most immediately, if we can get something showing people real time insights in meetings, we are WELL on our way to the next stage of our MVP.
 
Here is an example product: 
 
This is another one (although they built their own video meeting area, we do NOT want to do that but rather plug in as Equalicert has.):
 
 
We do NOT want to be a DEI product but a performance improvement, management, leadership, professional development product.
 
 
Here’s an overview:
 
 
This is the general UX idea.
 
- React/Node
- Python Tensorflow for the AWS ML Models
- We have NLP, and use Audio, Video and the Chat to analyze Emotions (audio) Video (eye movements for engagement) but we are not set on all of our models being integrated right now depending on what's fastest/easiest/possible to integrate to talk in real time with a zoom meeting.
 
Ideally we want:
- Interruption notifications (If someone is interrupting a lot, they get a ping)
- Speaking time (depending on context - so we have 8 different use cases roughly, if someone is monopolizing the conversation based on the context of the call, they get pinged. We will provide the % speaking time intervals for you)
- Emotions (help the meeting leader and individual participants understand how they sound. Is there voice coming across as stressed? anxious? Are they speaking faster than normal? We want to let them know.)*** This will set us apart if you can do this in real time by hooking up to the audio of the meeting and running it through our ML model during the meeting time and sending that information back to the Zoom user in a panel.
 
If we had those three prompts (integrating the machine learning models or not) this would be a HUGE win.
 
Core Deliverables:
- We need a Zoom marketplace approval for the app so users can download it using the marketplace: (we are not set on Zoom but it is preferrable. We need to start somewhere and ultimately will need to move to Teams, Meet capabilities so whatever direction we start in is fine.)
- Paywall for users to be able to pay in order to use the service, usage based, 10 hours meetings free then a price per hour, not determined yet.
In AWS our own app on where users can log in and see their meeting history results
- Admin dashboards (in the mockups) for an administrator of a company (group individual users into the company, also for managers of teams or teachers of a class for example who might need access to aggregated statistics based on groups of individuals in their organization) and
- Individual user dashboard (individual meeting stats that are collected)
 
Our current ML models can already use recordings to analyze videos so we need to hook those up to the dashboard. We have a terrible dashboard on bubble that we need to migrate over essentially. We use integromat to automate sequences.
 
I’ve got this to our devs, but I think I am missing some “tech” vocabulary and direction on this. 
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks!
  
Kalyna

Hi Kalyna,
 
We will start working on this first thing tomorrow and I will reach out to you if there will be any questions from the team.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry

Great – as for the other pitch, I’m seeing $1,000/month for two individuals to run email campaigns?
 
Are they doing appointment setting?
 
As mentioned on that end I was looking for a guaranteed result of some sort before paying for further BD/Sales help.

Hi Kalyna,
 
My apologies for taking longer than expected to get back to you but there were a few thorough details our team had to go through.
 
Please find below the link for the proposal.
{{Link}}
 
Happy to jump on a quick call to answer any questions. Afternoons work best for us.
 
For the email marketing campaigns, our original proposal was only revolving around LeadGen but we can surely offer you more for less as the referrals are our key interest here. We are right working on scaling our technology right now and are only a few weeks away. Please read about it here: 
{{Link}} (draft version)
 
Feel free to share any thoughts.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—--------------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this.
 
This quote is way out of budget for an MVP. How can you reduce this? I especially think 8 weeks for UX is extreme given our current wireframes already in existence, Zoom’s UI to leverage in app and the simplicity of what dashboard we’re asking for users to have access to meeting data.
 
If we were to simplify this MVP even further, what’s the cheapest you can go on a Zoom Marketplace app, integrating some basics like Equalicert has?
Would it be easier on Google as an extension like they have done?
 
I would love a few different options please.
 
Also, in your figmatic link, your videos are unaligned to the laptop screens.
 
I’ve attached an image for your reference.
 
If you can do something on the lead gen side, let me know. I’d love a trial or something along with the promise of sending you referrals upon success. I think this in combination with the MVP development would be a sweetspot for us.
 
Thanks!
 
Warmly,
Kalyna

"Hi {{Name}}, The boilerplate package includes:

1. Consultation to understand your business and create the campaign including:
     A. Problem-solution pairs
     B. Reframing (If you sell boats, don't sell the boat, sell time on the water)
     C. Drafting invitations to do business (copy that would go into campaigns)
     D. Anticipating objections and writing objections handling collateral
 2. Design (this is an add-on option)
     A. Creating embedded images that can be used to call attention to e-mail campaigns
     B. Designing the templates for use with the marketing and objection handling collateral

After the above 2 steps are done then we will have the ability to continue with...

1. Campaign setup
      A. Organizing the campaign/campaigns into a sequence of steps (e-mail, social, phone)
      B. Tracking progress across campaigns and sales reps (open rates, click-through rates, response rates, appointment rates, proposal rates, closing rates)
      C. Continual process of renewal (revisiting campaigns that are and are not performing well, new idea generation for new invitations to do business).
2. Lead sourcing
       A. Identifying lead sources
       B. Combination of manual and automatic scraping to gather leads and find contacts at those companies
3. Launch
       A. Combining the campaign with the lead sourcing to implement the campaign, contact leads, and monitor metrics

This package is our most basic package and includes several sales reps, a sales manager, the software we use to run the campaign, and myself or one of our other senior staff to draft the invitations to do business and campaign objection handling strategy.

I hope that helps answer your question. We'd like the opportunity to work together, but we don't have much room for the price.

Our most basic package runs ~ $5k per month for the above-mentioned with a minimum commitment of 3 months.

I'm not sure where we could remove/cut while having the campaign still be effective.

For example, if we don't spend the proper time creating the campaign and move to contact customers, we will not get a good response rate. On the other hand, if we don't have the sales support to contact customers we will not do the required numbers to get appointments and ultimately won business

By discussing these mock-ups, we will have a better idea of the brand image you want. We will repeat the process of design, review, and discussion until we achieve the look and feel that you love. After this, we will use the finalized design as a baseline to tell the rest of the story, in the UIUX, in the design of the products, and in the overall customer-facing, company presence. The end results will be the brand image that {{Company}} will be proud to display and which will communicate the propoer tone not only to the targeted market segment but also to the world at large.

Hi Ehsan
 
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  We are 100% focused on CES right now before we close for the holidays.

Thank you, Daniel

Hi Adam,
 
It would be helpful to have at least one query associated with the content, also we can normalize the data with the previous data we have by adding in data labeling for $1,500 one-time cost.

Regarding the API costs, do you mean for the old project, this project or both projects? In either case I need a bit more than advance notice of an invoice coming in.  I need a clear means of reporting so I can see usage and predict future costs. I'll take your suggestion but if you have no specific format in mind I would personally recommend a shared spreadsheet that you can keep updated with two tables (one per project), entering details of payments and usage as in the example attached - would this work for you? If so I can upload to our sharepoint and share with you.

"Hi {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} boost their B2C visibility, market share and profit through Punch’s B2C growth program. This program consists of a 4-step process:

1. Analysis — We dive deep into ads being run by your top 1 to 3 competitors on Facebook, AdWords, Google+, etc., to understand what they’re doing right and what you could be doing better. We perform analyses on keywords, SEO, website traffic and app store traffic, to see where you may be missing golden opportunities and where you may be losing your visitors. We gather data on,
Who are your customers?
How {{company}} is doing with getting them?
What does it cost to acquire a new customer?

This data helps us understand the hopes and fears of your prospects and how best to harness those attitudes to help them become new customers.

2. Plan creation — We take a survey of {{company}}’s current marketing channels to see what is being done now. This helps us understand what steps are being left out and what opportunities are being missed. Next, we analyze marketing channels new to {{company}} to determine the best approach for expanding your market reach. This is followed by tailoring a plan to achieve specific advertising milestones:
to grow every month {{company}}’s number of customers,
to get more engagement from existing customers which will strengthen their commitment to the {{company}} brand, and
to reduce customer churn.

We target double-digit, month-on-month growth in the initial, 90-day test, and an overall 50% reduction in customer churn.

3. Execution — We execute the plan, which always starts with original content creation. The plan includes monitoring and analysis of incremental results, plus daily meetings to review progress. It also includes ads management, engagement metrics, and regular performance review. We update the plan with any required changes to ensure we meet plan goals.

4. Refinement — We make daily, weekly, and monthly adjustments to the plan based on ongoing performance. Such refinements are based on monthly and quarterly customer acquisition, plus CPC and CPM benchmarks and metrics.

Overall goals:
Double-digit, month-on-month growth in new customers,
Grow existing customer engagement by 50%,
Reduce customer churn by 50%, and
Reduce ad cost per new customer acquisition by at least 20%.

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

I am also sharing some of our past and recent branding/design work but it's like a drop in the ocean. We have a team of experts who can just knock the ball out of the park for any work in 2D & 3D Animations, UI/UX, Branding, Product Photography, Graphics Work, Shopping Cart Design & Development, Theme Development, Copywriting, and Video Storytelling. Each individual we have in our team is a real gem.
 
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would need any changes.
 
Many thanks,
 
Sherry

I'm attaching the proposal to this email for your review. Hopefully, this meets all your requirements and is what you're looking for. We're really excited to get things off the ground!
 
We would love for you to meet our engineering lead in tomorrow's call.  {{Name}} is an industry veteran and the perfect candidate for this job. We can discuss how to proceed and kick things off as soon as possible in the best possible way.
 
We're pumped to make this happen and look forward to working with you.

Hi {{Name}},
 
I’m really sorry I missed the meeting.  I had a family emergency which is Ok now and I’m back in the office.

Again my apologies for missing the meeting.

Hi,
 
FYI – for the last 2 days we have had poor ISP service, this morning it was extremely bad.  Fortunately, the ISP provider technician found a bad junction wire at the pole just this morning (I just finished meeting with him), he replaced it and we now seem to have a solid connection and transfer rates.
 
I’m sharing this because if a new meeting time was sent I didn’t get it.  I have read the PP sent to me and I don’t have any questions at this time, I want to present it to Management on {{Day}}/{{Day}} and will use the PP for reference.
 
I propose, all things considered, we re-schedule after I have had a discussion with Management; does that sound good to you?

Hi {{Name}}, checking in – what are the next steps?

Hi {{Name}},

Hi,
 
The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.  This buys us a little breathing room but I am impressed with them it is only a short stay and we need to address this both in the intermediate-term and how it can be an option for any future… bottlenecks.

This is followed by a phone coversation to discuss how you envision your story being told. Then, we will create initial design mock-ups for your review. By discussing these mock-ups, we will have a better idea of the brand image you want. We will repeat the process of design, review, and discussion until we achieve the look and feel that you love.

"Hi {{Name}}, The boilerplate package includes:

1. Consultation to understand your business and create the campaign including:
     A. Problem-solution pairs
     B. Reframing (If you sell boats, don't sell the boat, sell time on the water)
     C. Drafting invitations to do business (copy that would go into campaigns)
     D. Anticipating objections and writing objections handling collateral
 2. Design (this is an add-on option)
     A. Creating embedded images that can be used to call attention to e-mail campaigns
     B. Designing the templates for use with the marketing and objection handling collateral

After the above 2 steps are done then we will have the ability to continue with...

1. Campaign setup
      A. Organizing the campaign/campaigns into a sequence of steps (e-mail, social, phone)
      B. Tracking progress across campaigns and sales reps (open rates, click-through rates, response rates, appointment rates, proposal rates, closing rates)
      C. Continual process of renewal (revisiting campaigns that are and are not performing well, new idea generation for new invitations to do business).
2. Lead sourcing
       A. Identifying lead sources
       B. Combination of manual and automatic scraping to gather leads and find contacts at those companies
3. Launch
       A. Combining the campaign with the lead sourcing to implement the campaign, contact leads, and monitor metrics

This package is our most basic package and includes several sales reps, a sales manager, the software we use to run the campaign, and myself or one of our other senior staff to draft the invitations to do business and campaign objection handling strategy.

I hope that helps answer your question. We'd like the opportunity to work together, but we don't have much room for the price.

Our most basic package runs ~ $5k per month for the above-mentioned with a minimum commitment of 3 months.

I'm not sure where we could remove/cut while having the campaign still be effective.

For example, if we don't spend the proper time creating the campaign and move to contact customers, we will not get a good response rate. On the other hand, if we don't have the sales support to contact customers we will not do the required numbers to get appointments and ultimately won business

It was wonderful talking to you today, that was such an interactive session. It seems like an opportunity for us to work together.

We'll start working on the proposal from our side and next week we can have a more technical discussion about our collaboration.

Let me know what time works the best for you next week for a call.

Cheers,
Raahim

—------------------------------------

Hello Raahim,
     Wanted to know if we can catch up this Thursday afternoon CST?

—-------------------------------------

Hey Brian,
 
Thanks for reaching back, 
 
I believe you have received the proposal from Sheharyar, we would love to walk you through the proposal and answer any questions you might have. 
 
Can we schedule a call for tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 PM (CST)? Let me know so I can send you the meeting invite.
 
Talk soon,
Raahim

—-------------------------------

Hello Brian, 
 
Pardon my professional persistence here, please let me know what time you want me to schedule a call today.
 
—----------------------------
 
Hey Raahim,
     No worries I need the press given how much email comes my way. I've seen your pdf and I'm looking forward to our call. Yes, I have time at the scheduled time with the team.   Let's chat today. 
 
—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

We partnered up with Combine VB to develop a categorization model that took bank statements and invoice details from enterprise customers to programmatically bucket spending.

We have put together a quick proposal to get the current model further trained.
 
{{Company_Name}} Proposal - (NLP Model Retraining):
 
I will share a copy of the new Exhibit for the Services Agreement with you today via DocuSign.
 
Our team is currently working on a demo about video personalization over scaleable email marketing campaigns. I wanted to learn about your availability for Friday or early next week for that. 
 
I will share the invites for the demo once you confirm. We are pretty excited to learn your thoughts on it.
 
Thanks,

—----------------------
 
Thanks Sherry
 
Regarding the data format, is approved client content that covers a new topic the model hasn't been trained on yet but that doesn't have any search queries associated to it still usable for training purposes?
 
Adam
 
—---------------------
 
Hi Adam,
 
It would be helpful to have at least one query associated with the content, also we can normalize the data with the previous data we have by adding in data labeling for $1,500 one-time cost.
 
Thanks,
Sherry
—------------------------
Thanks Sherry
 
We'll make sure there's at least 1 query per piece then, hopefully more.
 
Just to confirm the quote includes doing any necessary clean-up on the copy right? Last time you guys did stuff like stripping out HTML before training.
 
Adam
—-----------------------
Hi Adam,
 
Yes, that’s included as it helps us achieve optimal results.
 
If that sounds good, I will send a copy of the exhibit your way via DocuSign today.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
—---------------------
 
Go for it 
 
—------------------
Hi Adam,
 
I have put together a copy of the exhibit and shared it with you via DocuSign. I have attached a copy here for your review here as well.
 
In terms of API requests cost, we will share the monthly cost with you prior to the invoice. 
 
Feel free to reach out with any questions.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
—-----------------------
 
Hi Sherry
 
Thanks for this, I am still waiting for sign off on this but will review as and when we get there.
 
Regarding the API costs, do you mean for the old project, this project or both projects? In either case I need a bit more than advance notice of an invoice coming in.  I need a clear means of reporting so I can see usage and predict future costs. I'll take your suggestion but if you have no specific format in mind I would personally recommend a shared spreadsheet that you can keep updated with two tables (one per project), entering details of payments and usage as in the example attached - would this work for you? If so I can upload to our sharepoint and share with you.
 
Adam
—----------------------
 
Hi Adam,
 
The format works great for us. We can use this format for reporting the API cost and usage every month and you will be notified every time we update the sheet.
 
You can view the sheet here:
 
{{Link}}
 
We can also do this over your Sharepoint if you want but I will ensure that you will have crystal visibility before any invoice is generated.
 
Many thanks,

Hi,
 
FYI – for the last 2 days we have had poor ISP service, this morning it was extremely bad.  Fortunately, the ISP provider technician found a bad junction wire at the pole just this morning (I just finished meeting with him), he replaced it and we now seem to have a solid connection and transfer rates.
 
I’m sharing this because if a new meeting time was sent I didn’t get it.  I have read the PP sent to me and I don’t have any questions at this time, I want to present it to Management on {{Day}}/{{Day}} and will use the PP for reference.

Hi,
 
The meeting was held this morning with the same end result which is ‘hold’; primarily because one customer's implementation schedule was pushed out a quarter due to them having infra challenges.

We may need to define this better, but Iâ€™d like to get a rough idea what it would take to have your UX/UI folks do a quick, interim refresh of our mobile landing pages. There would be some minor functionality adjustments, but it would mostly be cosmetics. It might be easier and quick to just have my developer do the actual coding, but weâ€™d want some coordination to ensure that the implementation would be pretty straightforward. 
This is one of the few projects I might want to do before we pull in this next little round because I think the mobile presentation and UX is a little flat. BTW, the online version needs updating also, but I donâ€™t care too much about it. We might decide to do them both at the same time.

"We help companies like {{company}} design, develop and engineer products from the ground up. We specialize in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development so you can tell right away the long-term sustainability of a product concept before investing more time and money in creating all possible features. This significantly reduces your long-term risk.

Our MVP program follows 4 key Concept-to-Reality steps:

Brainstorming — We define the product using SWOT analysis, revenue model validation, product differentiation from competitors, and key feature definition.

Prioritizing — We define the feature timeline by shortlisting those features with maximum benefits, defining the minimum viable product, and by removing non-critical features from the pipeline.

Developing — We take the MVP project from concept to code by including QA, project management, a seasoned coding team, daily coding, creation of the minimum viable product, bi-weekly release cycle, continuous improvement, and weekly meetings to review product progress.

Scaling — We build the future, today, by preparing for mass commercialization, by planning out versions 2?5 features, and by identifying new sources of capital and growth.

Check out: http://www.punch.cool/services/engineering/

We would love to set up a call to discuss your concept, and to answer a few key questions. From this, we will return our complete analysis and proposed MVP timeline.

First my apologies for a long time between communications. We've been more than just busy and as with most projects, everything takes longer than expected.
 
In terms of our last conversation, I was able to reduce the number of pages to ~250 far less than the initial  800 and many of the pages still have a number of images ( in full size)  present. I kept the images as they are linked. with some more work, it could reduce the overall page count to ~200 or less......

Hi {{Name}},
 
The team just went through the scope and wanted to ask about the mind map and any excel sample sheet which is mentioned in the document.
 
They seem to be missing and was wondering if you can share those with us.
 
Thanks,

{{Name}},
 
Your previous data result ( Demo GUF data below)  and the fields are on track overall, the only real difference would be the deeper levels of descriptions for both the funding: ie.  timing of the offerings (rolling or deadlines) using our descriptors of their industries  (Industries column) for more granularity, ie: fintech then to hardware/service/software as an example.  Our schema has industries broken into subsets. Obviously, only available data for these subsets will be added to the final and ongoing database.   Does this assist in clarification?
 
 
I'm reviewing the referral agreement and will have some feedback next week.

"Hi {{Name}},
 
I found your company on Indeed and wanted to discuss how our ShadowProgram could help ITX Corp increase engineering productivity 2x in a 30-day pilot.
 
Our ShadowProgram pairs our ex-Google verified team of full-stack, back-end, and/or mobile engineers with your engineering team to double current engineering velocity; each of your engineer's ""Shadow"" will enable a 2-fold increase in storyboard tracker points delivered per sprint after the ShadowProgram is initiated within 30-days.
 
We've executed projects for Airware, Cape, PocketGems, Marie Kondo, The League, and over 70+ other companies and startups successfully with our ShadowProgram.
 
Our ShadowProgram often works in one of two ways –
 
1-to-1: Our engineers pair up 1-to-1 with your engineers, so each engineer on your team has a Punch Shadow that's doubling output, your engineer's ""Shadow"" is often working on the same feature or deliverable
 
Team-to-team: We split responsibilities by team, where we take certain features or milestones as well as your team members, and double overall output, often splitting up segments of work
 
I'd like to set up a call to discuss a 30-day pilot of our Shadow program with you, how does your calendar look this week and we can set up a time?
 
—-----------------------
Just a quick follow-up from my previous email about {{Our Company}} and how you can benefit from our services. 
 
I would love to have a conversation with you and discuss how {{Our Company}} can add value to {{Company_Name}}. Do you happen to be available anytime this week for a quick meet & greet call?

Thanks for reaching out. I may have some availability {{Day}} of next week, in the morning {{Timezone}}.
Please let me know if any time between {{Time}}  {{timezone}} and noon {{Timezone}} works for you.

I'll be waiting to receive the MSA from your side. {{Name}} (cc'd) would also be sharing some code samples of React & Node shortly. 
 
Thanks,
—-------------------
 
Thanks for sending the information.
Apologies, I had a long day of work on Friday and by the end of the day, I had forgotten about sending you the MSA.
Here is the MSA model, the SoW model, and the Contractor Agreement (that the individual contractors would need to sign to be notified of the expectations around non-compete, confidentiality, etc).
—-----------------------
 
Thank you for sending these over. I'll send you the signed copy shortly. 
 
Can you please specify this (screenshot below) as this is a bit confusing
—----------------------
 
As I think we are moving towards an agency contractor ship agreement the above-mentioned screenshot would not be required for us to fill.
 
Thanks,
—-------------------
 
Please find attached the signed copies of the MSA's from our side. We will keep the contractor agreement and get that signed when we start the augmentation process.
 
What does your calendar look like for Thursday or Friday this week to discuss further and start the augmentation process? 
 
Thanks,
—-----------------
 
{{Name}}
Sorry, I cannot see the screenshot you mention.
What I can provide as context, is that we use the same MSA for all types of engagements (C2C, C2H, and Direct Hire). That's why it has the provision of a ""hiring fee"" or a ""conversion fee"". 
It is the SoW that defines what is the engagement type, and in the case of agencies like yours, we would simply do a C2C, with no conversion clause. 
Hope that helps build the right context.
If you are in agreement with the MSA (understanding that it includes some clauses that will not be invoked) I can have our legal counsel send you a link for an electronic signature (with HelloSign).
—-------------------------
 
{{Name}}
Our Legal Counsel sent it on 11/04. And just re-sent e-signature through HelloSign
 
—----------------------
 
Got it now! It missed my Inbox. I have signed it from our side.
 
When are you available to discuss the next steps?

I have no availability this week, but we can try to find some time for next week.
I am including {{@Name}}, {{@Name}}, and {{@Name}} on CC so that one of them can also be included in the meeting since they are the ones that are mostly taking our global searches for talent.
 
—------------------------
 
Hi {{Name}}!
 
It was great to meet you too. 
 
The person you mention, for what position would it be? So we can schedule it.
 
I share the most critical positions that we need to cover:
 
Sr Frontend Developer: {{Link}}
Sr Backend Developer: {{Link}}
System Administrator: {{Link}}
DevOps Engineer: {{Link}}
 
It is mandatory for all positions that candidates have a fluent level of English. Especially for the DevOps position, this point is totally defining since it will have direct contact with the client.
In addition to fluency, we consider that communication skills, in general, are a key point, and so the ability of multi-location and multi-cultural teamwork.
 
Another important point is the possibility of working in the client's time: {{Time}} and for DevOps and SysAdmin the person should be able to cover on-call rotations.
 
If you need any other additional information, do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Thank you!
 
Greetings.

Hi Kalyna,
 
I would love to put together a proposal if I will have any details on the scope of work. It will allow us to share some team details, timelines, and cost estimates.
 
I can put together a quick document on the pricing and what you can expect from the team on Design and Development.
 
Let me know what you think and I can keep it moving forward here.

—---------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
A proposal ASAP before end of week would be very useful with a timeline (week over week) estimated delivery, cost and such so we can go to investors and be sure to get moving into development.
 
There is a current async ML component. We are not married to the idea of having to tie all of those models in real time to Zoom. However, they do need to show up in a meaningful way on the client’s dashboard at some point.
 
Most immediately, if we can get something showing people real time insights in meetings, we are WELL on our way to the next stage of our MVP.
 
Here is an example product: 
 
This is another one (although they built their own video meeting area, we do NOT want to do that but rather plug in as Equalicert has.):
 
 
We do NOT want to be a DEI product but a performance improvement, management, leadership, professional development product.
 
 
Here’s an overview:
 
 
This is the general UX idea.
 
- React/Node
- Python Tensorflow for the AWS ML Models
- We have NLP, and use Audio, Video and the Chat to analyze Emotions (audio) Video (eye movements for engagement) but we are not set on all of our models being integrated right now depending on what's fastest/easiest/possible to integrate to talk in real time with a zoom meeting.
 
Ideally we want:
- Interruption notifications (If someone is interrupting a lot, they get a ping)
- Speaking time (depending on context - so we have 8 different use cases roughly, if someone is monopolizing the conversation based on the context of the call, they get pinged. We will provide the % speaking time intervals for you)
- Emotions (help the meeting leader and individual participants understand how they sound. Is there voice coming across as stressed? anxious? Are they speaking faster than normal? We want to let them know.)*** This will set us apart if you can do this in real time by hooking up to the audio of the meeting and running it through our ML model during the meeting time and sending that information back to the Zoom user in a panel.
 
If we had those three prompts (integrating the machine learning models or not) this would be a HUGE win.
 
Core Deliverables:
- We need a Zoom marketplace approval for the app so users can download it using the marketplace: (we are not set on Zoom but it is preferrable. We need to start somewhere and ultimately will need to move to Teams, Meet capabilities so whatever direction we start in is fine.)
- Paywall for users to be able to pay in order to use the service, usage based, 10 hours meetings free then a price per hour, not determined yet.
In AWS our own app on where users can log in and see their meeting history results
- Admin dashboards (in the mockups) for an administrator of a company (group individual users into the company, also for managers of teams or teachers of a class for example who might need access to aggregated statistics based on groups of individuals in their organization) and
- Individual user dashboard (individual meeting stats that are collected)
 
Our current ML models can already use recordings to analyze videos so we need to hook those up to the dashboard. We have a terrible dashboard on bubble that we need to migrate over essentially. We use integromat to automate sequences.
 
I’ve got this to our devs, but I think I am missing some “tech” vocabulary and direction on this. 
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks!

Hi Kalyna,
 
We will start working on this first thing tomorrow and I will reach out to you if there will be any questions from the team.
 
Thanks,

Great – as for the other pitch, I’m seeing $1,000/month for two individuals to run email campaigns?
 
Are they doing appointment setting?
 
As mentioned on that end I was looking for a guaranteed result of some sort before paying for further BD/Sales help.
 
Thanks,

Hi Kalyna,
 
My apologies for taking longer than expected to get back to you but there were a few thorough details our team had to go through.
 
Please find below the link for the proposal.
{{Link}}
 
Happy to jump on a quick call to answer any questions. Afternoons work best for us.
 
For the email marketing campaigns, our original proposal was only revolving around LeadGen but we can surely offer you more for less as the referrals are our key interest here. We are right working on scaling our technology right now and are only a few weeks away. Please read about it here: 
{{Link}} (draft version)
 
Feel free to share any thoughts.
 
Thanks,

Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this.
 
This quote is way out of budget for an MVP. How can you reduce this? I especially think 8 weeks for UX is extreme given our current wireframes already in existence, Zoom’s UI to leverage in app and the simplicity of what dashboard we’re asking for users to have access to meeting data.
 
If we were to simplify this MVP even further, what’s the cheapest you can go on a Zoom Marketplace app, integrating some basics like Equalicert has?
Would it be easier on Google as an extension like they have done?
 
I would love a few different options please.
 
Also, in your figmatic link, your videos are unaligned to the laptop screens.
 
I’ve attached an image for your reference.
 
If you can do something on the lead gen side, let me know. I’d love a trial or something along with the promise of sending you referrals upon success. I think this in combination with the MVP development would be a sweetspot for us.
 
Thanks!
 
Warmly,
Kalyna

"We help companies like {{company}} design, develop and engineer products from the ground up. We specialize in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development so you can tell right away the long-term sustainability of a product concept before investing more time and money in creating all possible features. This significantly reduces your long-term risk.

Our MVP program follows 4 key Concept-to-Reality steps:

Brainstorming — We define the product using SWOT analysis, revenue model validation, product differentiation from competitors, and key feature definition.

Prioritizing — We define the feature timeline by shortlisting those features with maximum benefits, defining the minimum viable product, and by removing non-critical features from the pipeline.

Developing — We take the MVP project from concept to code by including QA, project management, a seasoned coding team, daily coding, creation of the minimum viable product, bi-weekly release cycle, continuous improvement, and weekly meetings to review product progress.

Scaling — We build the future, today, by preparing for mass commercialization, by planning out versions 2?5 features, and by identifying new sources of capital and growth.

Check out: http://www.punch.cool/services/engineering/

We would love to set up a call to discuss your concept, and to answer a few key questions. From this, we will return our complete analysis and proposed MVP timeline.

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  We are 100% focused on CES right now before we close for the holidays. 
 
Will you or someone from your team be at CES in January?  If so we can meet then or it will have to be in early February following my vacation. 
 
Thank you, Daniel
 



 
Hi Daniel,
 
Thanks for getting in touch. No, unfortunately, we will not be attending the CES this year, but we can schedule a meeting at the start of February as per your availability. 
 
I'm sharing my Calendly link, you can pick a tentative slot as per your schedule.
 
Looking forward,
Ehsan

Our ex-Google team specializes in the following:
Full-Stack Engineering

How's your schedule this week or the next? Book a meeting with me here.
Cheers,",1,,0.465322939
"Hi {{Name}},
 
I found your company on Indeed and wanted to discuss how our ShadowProgram could help ITX Corp increase engineering productivity 2x in a 30-day pilot.
 
Our ShadowProgram pairs our ex-Google verified team of full-stack, back-end, and/or mobile engineers with your engineering team to double current engineering velocity; each of your engineer's ""Shadow"" will enable a 2-fold increase in storyboard tracker points delivered per sprint after the ShadowProgram is initiated within 30-days.
 
We've executed projects for Airware, Cape, PocketGems, Marie Kondo, The League, and over 70+ other companies and startups successfully with our ShadowProgram.
 
Our ShadowProgram often works in one of two ways –
 
1-to-1: Our engineers pair up 1-to-1 with your engineers, so each engineer on your team has a Punch Shadow that's doubling output, your engineer's ""Shadow"" is often working on the same feature or deliverable
 
Team-to-team: We split responsibilities by team, where we take certain features or milestones as well as your team members, and double overall output, often splitting up segments of work
 
I'd like to set up a call to discuss a 30-day pilot of our Shadow program with you, how does your calendar look this week and we can set up a time?
 
—-----------------------
Just a quick follow-up from my previous email about {{Our Company}} and how you can benefit from our services.

Thanks for sending the information.
Apologies, I had a long day of work on Friday and by the end of the day, I had forgotten about sending you the MSA.
Here is the MSA model, the SoW model, and the Contractor Agreement (that the individual contractors would need to sign to be notified of the expectations around non-compete, confidentiality, etc).
—-----------------------
 
Thank you for sending these over. I'll send you the signed copy shortly. 
 
Can you please specify this (screenshot below) as this is a bit confusing
—----------------------
 
As I think we are moving towards an agency contractor ship agreement the above-mentioned screenshot would not be required for us to fill.
 
Thanks,
—-------------------
 
Please find attached the signed copies of the MSA's from our side. We will keep the contractor agreement and get that signed when we start the augmentation process.
 
What does your calendar look like for Thursday or Friday this week to discuss further and start the augmentation process? 
 
Thanks,
—-----------------
 
{{Name}}
Sorry, I cannot see the screenshot you mention.
What I can provide as context, is that we use the same MSA for all types of engagements (C2C, C2H, and Direct Hire). That's why it has the provision of a ""hiring fee"" or a ""conversion fee"". 
It is the SoW that defines what is the engagement type, and in the case of agencies like yours, we would simply do a C2C, with no conversion clause. 
Hope that helps build the right context.
If you are in agreement with the MSA (understanding that it includes some clauses that will not be invoked) I can have our legal counsel send you a link for an electronic signature (with HelloSign).
—-------------------------
 
{{Name}}
Our Legal Counsel sent it on 11/04. And just re-sent e-signature through HelloSign

Hi {{Name}}!
 
It was great to meet you too. 
 
The person you mention, for what position would it be? So we can schedule it.
 
I share the most critical positions that we need to cover:
 
Sr Frontend Developer: {{Link}}
Sr Backend Developer: {{Link}}
System Administrator: {{Link}}
DevOps Engineer: {{Link}}
 
It is mandatory for all positions that candidates have a fluent level of English. Especially for the DevOps position, this point is totally defining since it will have direct contact with the client.
In addition to fluency, we consider that communication skills, in general, are a key point, and so the ability of multi-location and multi-cultural teamwork.
 
Another important point is the possibility of working in the client's time: {{Time}} and for DevOps and SysAdmin the person should be able to cover on-call rotations.
 
If you need any other additional information, do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Thank you!
 
Greetings.

We do this by accessing 10,000+ job boards, conference listings, and more, building a list of active prospects. From there, our sales team reaches out to these potential customers to set up appointments. Then, we loop in your team to these appointments, including pitch writing, adjustment, analysis, relationship building and finally closing.

"Hi {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} boost their B2C visibility, market share and profit through Punch’s B2C growth program. This program consists of a 4-step process:

1. Analysis — We dive deep into ads being run by your top 1 to 3 competitors on Facebook, AdWords, Google+, etc., to understand what they’re doing right and what you could be doing better. We perform analyses on keywords, SEO, website traffic and app store traffic, to see where you may be missing golden opportunities and where you may be losing your visitors. We gather data on,
Who are your customers?
How {{company}} is doing with getting them?
What does it cost to acquire a new customer?

This data helps us understand the hopes and fears of your prospects and how best to harness those attitudes to help them become new customers.

2. Plan creation — We take a survey of {{company}}’s current marketing channels to see what is being done now. This helps us understand what steps are being left out and what opportunities are being missed. Next, we analyze marketing channels new to {{company}} to determine the best approach for expanding your market reach. This is followed by tailoring a plan to achieve specific advertising milestones:
to grow every month {{company}}’s number of customers,
to get more engagement from existing customers which will strengthen their commitment to the {{company}} brand, and
to reduce customer churn.

We target double-digit, month-on-month growth in the initial, 90-day test, and an overall 50% reduction in customer churn.

3. Execution — We execute the plan, which always starts with original content creation. The plan includes monitoring and analysis of incremental results, plus daily meetings to review progress. It also includes ads management, engagement metrics, and regular performance review. We update the plan with any required changes to ensure we meet plan goals.

4. Refinement — We make daily, weekly, and monthly adjustments to the plan based on ongoing performance. Such refinements are based on monthly and quarterly customer acquisition, plus CPC and CPM benchmarks and metrics.

Overall goals:
Double-digit, month-on-month growth in new customers,
Grow existing customer engagement by 50%,
Reduce customer churn by 50%, and
Reduce ad cost per new customer acquisition by at least 20%.

Hey Raahim,
     No worries I need the press given how much email comes my way. I've seen your pdf and I'm looking forward to our call. Yes, I have time at the scheduled time with the team.   Let's chat today. 
 
—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.

"Hi {{Name}}, Thanks for reaching out. To launch and maintain these campaigns is an enormous amount of work. We need to spend the time to...
 
1. Understand your business
2. Think creatively about how to reach customers (invitations to do business derived from problem-solution pairs).
3. Identify creative ways to find leads.
4. Create the campaigns in a way where we have a 360-degree view of the customer (Social, email, phone, chat)
5. Work the pipeline and stay engaged while we help build a relationship with the prospect
6. Ultimately move them along to a close.
 
In addition to the above steps, we have to work with clients on upgrading their collateral and website because those pieces dictate the extent to which we can support them.
 
I understand that you would like to move forward however we cannot do this work without being paid for it. I understand that you want a results-driven team, however, our outreach projects are structured with both components:
 
A.) A monthly stipend to pay the bills and all the above creative work.
B.) A contingency commission that is paid to the sales rep for them to stay motivated.
 
I think you will have a hard time finding a quality team that will execute what you want strictly on a contingency basis.
 
If things change feel free to reach out.

I completely understand your concern regarding the timelines and cost estimates that we have proposed for this project. As far as the proportionality of pricing to the efficiency and quality of work are related, Punch’s expertise will never be questioned from your side, we make sure we deliver within the timelines that have been put forward by our team.
 
Also, as we had a brief intro, I would suggest a detailed discussion of your necessities and extent of work in our next call and that will allow me to revise the cost and timelines more accurately, taking into account the current needs of {{Company}}.
Let’s get on the phone and talk this out further.

"Hi {{Name}}, We help companies like {{company}} boost their B2C visibility, market share and profit through Punch’s B2C growth program. This program consists of a 4-step process:

1. Analysis — We dive deep into ads being run by your top 1 to 3 competitors on Facebook, AdWords, Google+, etc., to understand what they’re doing right and what you could be doing better. We perform analyses on keywords, SEO, website traffic and app store traffic, to see where you may be missing golden opportunities and where you may be losing your visitors. We gather data on,
Who are your customers?
How {{company}} is doing with getting them?
What does it cost to acquire a new customer?

This data helps us understand the hopes and fears of your prospects and how best to harness those attitudes to help them become new customers.

2. Plan creation — We take a survey of {{company}}’s current marketing channels to see what is being done now. This helps us understand what steps are being left out and what opportunities are being missed. Next, we analyze marketing channels new to {{company}} to determine the best approach for expanding your market reach. This is followed by tailoring a plan to achieve specific advertising milestones:
to grow every month {{company}}’s number of customers,
to get more engagement from existing customers which will strengthen their commitment to the {{company}} brand, and
to reduce customer churn.

We target double-digit, month-on-month growth in the initial, 90-day test, and an overall 50% reduction in customer churn.

3. Execution — We execute the plan, which always starts with original content creation. The plan includes monitoring and analysis of incremental results, plus daily meetings to review progress. It also includes ads management, engagement metrics, and regular performance review. We update the plan with any required changes to ensure we meet plan goals.

4. Refinement — We make daily, weekly, and monthly adjustments to the plan based on ongoing performance. Such refinements are based on monthly and quarterly customer acquisition, plus CPC and CPM benchmarks and metrics.

Overall goals:
Double-digit, month-on-month growth in new customers,
Grow existing customer engagement by 50%,
Reduce customer churn by 50%, and
Reduce ad cost per new customer acquisition by at least 20%.

"Hey Daniel,
 
We found you on glassdoor and love the direction of your company! We would like to discuss the possibility of building an MVP Demo for you to achieve future rounds of funding and obtain more customers.
 
We are a team of former Google Engineers and Designers with highly successful apps currently in the app store with high customer satisfaction, excellent UX, and five-star ratings. 
 
Our app, Cinemarun, takes advantage of Apple’s rich multi-channel ecosystem to deliver an app experience for phones, watches, and TV.
 
We have worked with exciting startups like Vantage Robotics, Cape, Founder Suite, 1-Page, Andy OS, Dispatchr, and many others.
 
One of our current Drone clients just utilized our work to receive an additional $5 Million funding round and we would like to discuss doing the same for you.
 
Check out our work here: 
 
15 minutes is all we need to show you how this works. If you are available one morning this week or next, I would be glad to arrange a call.
 
Have a great day.

Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—--------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this I’ll have a look.
 
I’d love your take on the app as well.
 
Can you send the separate proposal for that?
 
Much appreciated,
Kalyna 
 
—---------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
I would love to put together a proposal if I will have any details on the scope of work. It will allow us to share some team details, timelines, and cost estimates.
 
I can put together a quick document on the pricing and what you can expect from the team on Design and Development.
 
Let me know what you think and I can keep it moving forward here.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—---------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
A proposal ASAP before end of week would be very useful with a timeline (week over week) estimated delivery, cost and such so we can go to investors and be sure to get moving into development.
 
There is a current async ML component. We are not married to the idea of having to tie all of those models in real time to Zoom. However, they do need to show up in a meaningful way on the client’s dashboard at some point.
 
Most immediately, if we can get something showing people real time insights in meetings, we are WELL on our way to the next stage of our MVP.
 
Here is an example product: 
 
This is another one (although they built their own video meeting area, we do NOT want to do that but rather plug in as Equalicert has.):
 
 
We do NOT want to be a DEI product but a performance improvement, management, leadership, professional development product.
 
 
Here’s an overview:
 
 
This is the general UX idea.
 
- React/Node
- Python Tensorflow for the AWS ML Models
- We have NLP, and use Audio, Video and the Chat to analyze Emotions (audio) Video (eye movements for engagement) but we are not set on all of our models being integrated right now depending on what's fastest/easiest/possible to integrate to talk in real time with a zoom meeting.
 
Ideally we want:
- Interruption notifications (If someone is interrupting a lot, they get a ping)
- Speaking time (depending on context - so we have 8 different use cases roughly, if someone is monopolizing the conversation based on the context of the call, they get pinged. We will provide the % speaking time intervals for you)
- Emotions (help the meeting leader and individual participants understand how they sound. Is there voice coming across as stressed? anxious? Are they speaking faster than normal? We want to let them know.)*** This will set us apart if you can do this in real time by hooking up to the audio of the meeting and running it through our ML model during the meeting time and sending that information back to the Zoom user in a panel.
 
If we had those three prompts (integrating the machine learning models or not) this would be a HUGE win.
 
Core Deliverables:
- We need a Zoom marketplace approval for the app so users can download it using the marketplace: (we are not set on Zoom but it is preferrable. We need to start somewhere and ultimately will need to move to Teams, Meet capabilities so whatever direction we start in is fine.)
- Paywall for users to be able to pay in order to use the service, usage based, 10 hours meetings free then a price per hour, not determined yet.
In AWS our own app on where users can log in and see their meeting history results
- Admin dashboards (in the mockups) for an administrator of a company (group individual users into the company, also for managers of teams or teachers of a class for example who might need access to aggregated statistics based on groups of individuals in their organization) and
- Individual user dashboard (individual meeting stats that are collected)
 
Our current ML models can already use recordings to analyze videos so we need to hook those up to the dashboard. We have a terrible dashboard on bubble that we need to migrate over essentially. We use integromat to automate sequences.
 
I’ve got this to our devs, but I think I am missing some “tech” vocabulary and direction on this. 
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks!
  
Kalyna

Hi Kalyna,
 
We will start working on this first thing tomorrow and I will reach out to you if there will be any questions from the team.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry

Great – as for the other pitch, I’m seeing $1,000/month for two individuals to run email campaigns?
 
Are they doing appointment setting?
 
As mentioned on that end I was looking for a guaranteed result of some sort before paying for further BD/Sales help.
 
Thanks,
Kalyna
—--------------------
 
Hi Kalyna,
 
My apologies for taking longer than expected to get back to you but there were a few thorough details our team had to go through.
 
Please find below the link for the proposal.
{{Link}}
 
Happy to jump on a quick call to answer any questions. Afternoons work best for us.
 
For the email marketing campaigns, our original proposal was only revolving around LeadGen but we can surely offer you more for less as the referrals are our key interest here. We are right working on scaling our technology right now and are only a few weeks away. Please read about it here: 
{{Link}} (draft version)
 
Feel free to share any thoughts.
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry
 
—--------------------------
 
Hey Sherry,
 
Thanks for this.
 
This quote is way out of budget for an MVP. How can you reduce this? I especially think 8 weeks for UX is extreme given our current wireframes already in existence, Zoom’s UI to leverage in app and the simplicity of what dashboard we’re asking for users to have access to meeting data.
 
If we were to simplify this MVP even further, what’s the cheapest you can go on a Zoom Marketplace app, integrating some basics like Equalicert has?
Would it be easier on Google as an extension like they have done?
 
I would love a few different options please.
 
Also, in your figmatic link, your videos are unaligned to the laptop screens.
 
I’ve attached an image for your reference.
 
If you can do something on the lead gen side, let me know. I’d love a trial or something along with the promise of sending you referrals upon success. I think this in combination with the MVP development would be a sweetspot for us.
 
Thanks!
 
Warmly,
Kalyna

1. Research
2. Demand Generation
3. Meetings/Appointments (relationship building)
4. Closing (revenue generation)
These four steps generate a revenue-building system from scratch. This means that, unlike other companies, we do more than merely set appointments. For instance, our team of researchers gathers live data for prospects who are in the market, right now, for your solution. We do this by accessing 10,000+ job boards, conference listings, and more, building a list of active prospects. From there, our sales team reaches out to these potential customers to set up appointments. Then, we loop in your team to these appointments, including pitch writing, adjustment, analysis, relationship building and finally closing. Once we start working together, we will write the pitches using your collateral, and schedule a kickoff with our sales and research teams to consult with you on constructing the initial lists.

We’ve worked with Marie Kondo, Dispatchr, Cape, SoChat, and 100’s of other successful companies designing and engineering solutions for their needs.
 
If you have a time-sensitive project, let’s set up a time to discuss it – we can typically get up to speed on the day of the call and have a certified Salesforce engineer working on the project within 48 hours.
 
Please let me know if we can discuss it later today?
 
—------------------------------
 
Hello Piyush,
 
Following up on the below. I believe Punch can help Kyra Solutions’s engineering Salesforce Roadmap. 
 
Please let me know if we can discuss it?
 
—------------------------
 
 
Hello Piyush,
 
I’m writing to share a successful Salesforce development case study with you and to follow up on the below email.
 
Access the case study here.
 
I’m hoping we can set up a time to talk later today?
 
—------------------------
 
 
Hello,
 
We got this email from you and would like to learn more about your services and delivery model. Do you have more information that you could please email me?
 
Thanks,

Hey Prashant,
 
 I would like to highlight that we offer a ShadowProgram which pairs our ex-Google verified Salesforce developers with your developers to give each their own “shadow” instantly within 24 to 48 hrs. 
 
Our delivery model can also be on a project basis, contingency basis or hiring basis.
 
I'm attaching a case study for our Salesforce Capabilities for your reference.
 
What time works for you early next week to discuss this further?
 
Thanks,
 
Sherry

"Subject: Requesting information 


{{Name}},
 
First my apologies for a long time between communications. We've been more than just busy and as with most projects, everything takes longer than expected.
 
In terms of our last conversation, I was able to reduce the number of pages to ~250 far less than the initial  800 and many of the pages still have a number of images ( in full size)  present. I kept the images as they are linked. with some more work, it could reduce the overall page count to ~200 or less......
 
Let me know your updated thoughts and let's continue our interaction as the other aspect of our project, web scraping using python with the appropriate returns is still in play and this database would get that off the ground effectively.

I apologize for the delay however, it's better for both our firms to have the granularity needed to ensure a great outcome.  
 
Not certain if I missed the referral agreement we discussed?
 
Will be in touch next week, with updated details.

Hi {{Name}},
 
That sounds like a plan. We can jump on a quick call as soon as you will share something with us.
 
In terms of the next steps. we would love to put together a quick proposal outlining the cost and the estimates there.
 
I will follow up on {{Day}} again if I would not hear from you by then.

As promised the updated SOW. 
 
I trust that this will clarify our engagement a bit more deeply than the minimal statement in the last proposal you sent.

Also want to follow up on a referral agreement...

Hi {{Name}},
 
Happy {{Day}} and thank you for putting these details together. I have already shared it with our team and they might come up with some questions today or tomorrow.
 
In the meantime, we will start working on putting together a quick proposal and aim to share it by {{Day}}/{{Day}} this week.

Hi {{Name}},
 
The team just went through the scope and wanted to ask about the mind map and any excel sample sheet which is mentioned in the document.
 
They seem to be missing and was wondering if you can share those with us.
 
Thanks,




{{Name}},
 
Your previous data result ( Demo GUF data below)  and the fields are on track overall, the only real difference would be the deeper levels of descriptions for both the funding: ie.  timing of the offerings (rolling or deadlines) using our descriptors of their industries  (Industries column) for more granularity, ie: fintech then to hardware/service/software as an example.  Our schema has industries broken into subsets. Obviously, only available data for these subsets will be added to the final and ongoing database.   Does this assist in clarification?
 
 
I'm reviewing the referral agreement and will have some feedback next week.

Hi {{Name}},
 
This clarifies a lot of details and we can definitely share the proposal now before the day ends tomorrow.

—------------------------------
 
Hello All,
       Below you will find some general context for what we are thinking for AEO Interactive.  These are still high level, but I believe this can help us begin a substantive conversation ahead of our call.  Thanks all.
 
-Brian
 
AEO Interactive
 
AEO Interactive is a single point of entry, single brand, 4 part set of software tools created to engage creating value for our constituents, which are small and microbusinesses who could benefit from a better financial picture and acumen.  Our goal is to empower those entities with our suite of tools to increase their opportunity for success.  Our four anticipated tools are:
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
AEO Interactive – RESILI
AEO Interactive - vCFO
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
 
 
AEO Interactive – Line of Credit
We have a financial partner that can provide capital to our members in the form of a line of credit.  We want to be able to understand the financial position of a user’s business and, based on the data from their bank transactions as imported via using Finicity (https://www.finicity.com/), we want to be able to know that a company may run into financial trouble, and may need a line of credit.  Our goal is to catch a company before they are truly in trouble with their working capital needs. 
 
We expect to have a workflow where a user can understand if their past financial behavior will lead to a financial risk.  We want to then engage them to make a line of credit available to them via our bank partners.
 
Im thinking an online web app, React.js dashboard type of UI (open to all ideas here) where a user logs in, goes through terms and security agreements/consent, gives us information we use to connect to their business bank account, we utilize Finicity in the backend to securely get the data into our system, we then run a predictive algorithm to understand the financial / working capital risks to the business.  We make an assessment of some sort, notify the user, present them with options, and facilitate their referral to our banking partner for a line of credit $10K or more.
 
 
AEO Interactive – RESILI
RESILI is our learning management system based on LearnDash and Wordpress.  We are currently active with RESILI and it is live for other purposes unrelated to AEO Interactive.  However, a deliverable of AEO Interactive is a training and learning component.  We expect to utilize our current RESILI website and, in a sense, ‘white label to ourselves’ and create an area of RESILI that looks like the rest of AEO Interactive, and also has content that reflects the subject matter areas we are engaging via AEO Interactive.  You will not be responsible for the actual content.  The AEO Interactive area within RESILI will be informed by cultural behaviors we will use to connect with our user’s needs, and we will inform you of those details as needed. 
https://resili.aeoworks.org/
 
 
 
AEO Interactive – vCFO
This is a virtual chief financial officer.  We are exploring ways to deliver this value and have not settled on an approach, so creativity is an open option.  We (internally) did discuss the idea of using a telehealth model, where theirs a one-on-one personal connection via video and data/document sharing, to engage the small business with a trained fractional / virtual CFO to help them engage their finances.  CFOs are expensive and small businesses do not have the means to afford a full time CFO.  We want to make it sensible for them to get an on demand or partial/fractional CFO virtually to help them make good decisions and understand their finances better. 
 
Regarding technology delivery, assuming the telehealth model is best, we will create a solution that includes both a web and mobile application, to engage users with a live video based ‘consultations’ with a virtual CFO (vCFO) to engage their business financial needs.  They should be able to share information, documents, screens, and communicate. Calls should be recordable (with double consent) and referenceable. 
 
AEO Interactive – Financial Management
Financial management is our UI overlay/UI layer that will interface directly with Intuit’s Quickbooks.  Our users generally use Quickbooks if they use accounting software, so we want to make Quickbooks more aligned with our users.  We want a look and feel, ratios and other aspects of quicbooks that works for our users.  What ratios?  What ‘look and feel’ do we mean? 
To us, “look and feel” is a simplification of the typical Quickbooks UI for our user.  The goal is making common business metrics for financial health across industries easy to see, impact, and know by a new business owner.  Yes, theres a bit of background we’d need to provide to give you the opportunity to know what ‘metrics and kpi’ we’d need to simplify within our UI experience of Quickbooks. 
The purpose goal is to make it easy for our users to know whats going on, and easy for them to input the right things, the right way, to accurately reflect their businesses, as our users find Quickbooks cumbersome and at times confusing.
